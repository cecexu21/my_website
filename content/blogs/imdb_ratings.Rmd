# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

We all like movies, right? But do directors influence movie ratings? Or, genres? Or, anything else?
![](https://github.com/cecexu21/my_website/blob/main/steven.jpeg)


Recall the IMBD ratings data. We want to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. In order to test it, we need to calculate confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as we can see they overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```


In addition, we will run a hpothesis test. We should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?


Null Hypothesis- both Spielberg and Burton have the same mean rating.
Alternative Hypothesis- Spielberg and Burton have the distinct mean ratings.
p-value- /alpha=0.05


```{r load-movies-data, cache=TRUE}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```
Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 

Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I`
