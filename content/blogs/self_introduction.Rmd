```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/aee91187a9c6811a802ddc524c3271302893a149/a7003/images/bandthree2.png")
```

**R can also be used to show my hometown, Shanghai! **

###**Welcome to Shanghai!**

There are a lot of districts in SHANGHAI, such as Jingan District, Huangpu District, Xuhui District, Pudong District, etc..

Firstly, let us start the journey from viewing the whole city!


```{r, map of shanghai, echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)

Shanghai <- leaflet() %>% 
  setView(lng = 121.468888888889, lat = 31.2358333333333, zoom = 10) %>% 
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") 
Shanghai
```
\n\
Now, let me introduces some fascinating destinations in Shanghai.
There are five most famous destinations in Shanghai!

```{r,destinations in shanghai, echo=FALSE}
destinations<-data.frame(place=c("Shanghai Museum","Yu Garden","Shanghai Disneyland","The Bund","Shanghai Tower"),
                         lat=c(31.230278,31.22416577,31.1453, 31.233501,31.2503),
             lng=c(121.470550,121.48583139,121.6573, 121.505760,121.5064))
kable(head(destinations),align="l")
```
