> Hi, my name is Chengchen Xu, but you can also call me Cissie Xu, this is totally up to you!
Currently, I'm studying in MFA program to learn more finance-oriented stuff. Before I started my journey in LBS, I studied in Fudan University for four years and had a great exchange studying time in CA, USA. (The photo above is the one that shot in Los Angeles.) Hope this picture can make you happy all the time!

Since you have already seen the picture of me, do you want to know more about me?

Firstly, still let me introduce my education background!

### Here are two Shiny widgets

```{r echo = FALSE}
selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20)
  
sliderInput("bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
              min = 0.2, max = 2, value = 1, step = 0.2)
```

### ...that build a histogram.

```{r echo = FALSE}
renderPlot({
  hist(faithful$eruptions, probability = TRUE, 
       breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
       xlab = "Duration (minutes)", 
       main = "Geyser eruption duration")
  
  dens <- density(faithful$eruptions, adjust = input$bw_adjust)
  lines(dens, col = "blue")
})
```
