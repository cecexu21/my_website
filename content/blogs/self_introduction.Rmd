knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/aee91187a9c6811a802ddc524c3271302893a149/a7003/images/bandthree2.png")

R can also be used to show my hometown, Shanghai! 


```{r}
library(leaflet)

Shanghai <- leaflet() %>% 
  setView(lng = 121.468888888889, lat = 31.2358333333333, zoom = 10) %>% 
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron")
