Hi, my name is Chengchen Xu, but you can also call me Cissie Xu, this is totally up to you!
Currently, I'm studying in MFA program to learn more finance-oriented stuff. Before I started my journey in LBS, I studied in Fudan University for four years and had a great time of exchanging life in CA, USA.
