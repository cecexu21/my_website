# Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

With bike shops selling out and public transport best avoided, London’s fleet of rental bikes could be the solution for safe commuting around the capital during - and beyond - coronavirus.

London has long had its own TfL backed bike rental system. New figures released by Transport for London (TfL) show that membership of its Santander Cycles scheme rose by 157% in the year to December 2020, representing the largest increase in the scheme’s 10-year history. Meanwhile, new annual memberships increased by a quarter.

Total hire numbers for 2020 were 10,434,167 – an increase of around 6,000 hires from 2019 – despite a significant overall reduction in journeys across London during the pandemic. The figures prove that the scheme provided a lifeline to tens of thousands of Londoners by enabling them to safely make essential journeys during the coronavirus pandemic. [Covid-19: Transport for London reports record 157% increase in bike share registrations](https://www.traffictechnologytoday.com/news/covid-19-news/covid-19-transport-for-london-reports-record-157-increase-in-bike-share-registrations.html)


## Downloading and cleaning data
We download the latest TFL data and read it as a dataframe. Then we change the date variables to get year, month and week. 


```{r get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"


# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```

We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/tfl_distributions_monthly.png", error = FALSE)
```

**Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?**
\n\
Looking at the facet grid chart with the number of bikes hired by month and year, we see a much smaller peak in May and June 2020 compared to previous years.
What we see is that number of days with a high number of rentals, aprx. 30-50k is much less than previous years. 
The number of bikes rented each day is much more inconsistent and varies along the entire spectrum. 
This is a result of COVID lockdown, where bike usage patterns changed. We see that the rentals take up again in July, when lockdown was lifted, and the distribution starts to normalize.  

## Reproducing graphs

In order to show whether there is an apparent increasing trend during pandemic, we generate more visualized graph to show the actual rentals and expected rentals. 

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=TRUE, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/tfl_monthly.png", error = FALSE)
```


```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=TRUE, out.width="100%", cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/tfl_weekly.png", error = FALSE)
```


We are creating the first plot:
```{r tfl_plot_1, cache=TRUE}
data_bike <-bike %>%
  group_by(month,year) %>% #grouping by month and year
  summarize(actual_rentals=mean(bikes_hired)) #selecting by the number of bikes hired to create the number of bikes hired by every month of each year

expected_bike <-data_bike %>%
  group_by(month) %>% #grouping by month
  filter(year %in% c(2016,2017,2018,2019)) %>% #filtering the months we want to analyse
  summarize(expected_rentals=mean(actual_rentals)) #selecting by the number of bikes hired to create the number of bikes hired by every month overall no matter the year

df3 <- left_join(data_bike, expected_bike, by = c("month")) %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2016,2017,2018,2019,2020,2021)) %>% #filtering the months we want to analyse
  mutate(excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals, #using the mutate function to obtain the excess rentals
         up = ifelse(actual_rentals>expected_rentals, actual_rentals, expected_rentals), #using the mutate function to obtain the excess rentals
         down = ifelse(actual_rentals<expected_rentals, actual_rentals, expected_rentals)) #using the mutate function to obtain the deficit rentals

ggplot(df3,aes(x=month,y=actual_rentals,group=1))+
  geom_line(colour="black",size=0.2)+ #plotting the rentals observed by month

  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=actual_rentals,ymax=up),fill="#CB454A",alpha=0.4)+ #filling in green the excess of bike rentals
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=down,ymax=actual_rentals),fill="#7DCD85",alpha=0.4)  + #filling in red the deficit of bike rentals
  facet_wrap(~year)+ #faceting by year
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="Monthly changes in Tfl bike rentals",
       subtitle = "Change from monthly average shown in blue

```

We are creating the second plot:
```{r tfl_plot_2, cache=TRUE}
df4 <-bike %>%
  group_by(year,week) %>% #grouping by month
  filter(year>2015,week!=53) %>% #filtering for the year we are interested in and setting the number of weeks
  summarize(weekly_average=mean(bikes_hired)) #creating the average mean of bikes hired by every week of each year

df5 <-df4 %>%
  group_by(week) %>% #grouping by week
  filter(year>2015,week!=53) %>% #filtering for the year we are interested in and setting the number of weeks
  summarize(weekly_average_overall=mean(weekly_average)) #creating the average mean of bikes hired every week no matter the year

df6 <- left_join(df4, df5, by = c("week"))%>% 
  mutate(week_diff = ((weekly_average-weekly_average_overall)/weekly_average_overall))%>% #creating the difference of expected bike rentals vs actual bikes rental
  select(year, week, week_diff) %>% #selecting for the columns that we will use
  mutate(positive=if_else(0<week_diff,week_diff,0), #creating a function to calculate the bike rentals deficit
         negative=if_else(0>week_diff,week_diff,0),colorID=if_else(0<week_diff,"#7DCD85","#CB454A"))  #creating a function to calculate the bike rentals excess

ggplot(df6,aes(x=week,y=week_diff,ymin=-0.6,ymax=1))+
  geom_line(group = 1) + #plotting the bike rentals
  geom_rug(data = df6, aes(color=colorID, alpha=0.4), sides = "b") + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0, ymax=negative), fill="#CB454A", alpha= 0.4)+ #colouring the deficit of bikes rentals in red

When using a lot of data to estimate future performance of rentals in London. Here is a question for you to think about.

**Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?**\n\
Answer is: We use mean because it is widely used in statistics world, since it can average all the variables and reduce the nagative effects of extreme numbers, which means outliers in our data.
